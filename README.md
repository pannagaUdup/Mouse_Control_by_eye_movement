# Mouse_Control_by_eye_movement
Novel algorithm for controlling the movement of a computer screen cursor 
and scrolling using the iris movement. Transformation of a commercial eye tracker for use as an 
alternative peripheral device in human-computer interactions, implementing a pointer 
that only needs the eye movements of a user facing a computer screen, 
thus replacing the need to control the software by hand movements.
